#1. Code to display Name, and Department.
Name="Yakubu John Bitrus"
Dept="Computer Science"
print("Name:-",Name,"\n","Department:-",Dept)

#2. Assign a string 'Boo!' and variable 'Scare' then print the variable.
Scare="Boo!"
print(Scare)

#3.Add two variables and assign the result to the third variable, print all the variable names.
Var1=15
Var2=3
Var3=(Var1+Var2)
print("Var1:",Var1,"\n","Var2:",Var2,"\n""Var3:",Var3)

#4.Divide 12 by the decimal .5 and assign the result to the variable outcome and print the result.
A=12
B=0.5
print("Result:",A/B)

#5.Assign the sum of two numbers to a variable and print the variable.
Sum=(Var1+Var2)
print("Result:",Sum)

#6.Write the code that finds the remainder when 8 is divided by 3.
ValueA=8
ValueB=3
print("Remainder:",ValueA%ValueB)

#7.First multiply 2 by 4 then add 4 and 2. then multiply the first result by the second.
NumberA=4
NumberB=2
First_total=(NumberA*NumberB)
Second_total=(NumberA+NumberB)
Final_answer=(First_total*Second_total)
print("Multiplied:",First_total,"\n","Sum:",Second_total,"\n","Final Answer:",Final_answer)
